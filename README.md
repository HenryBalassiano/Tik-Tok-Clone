## What is it?

A clone of the popular app TikTok, using the Reddit API it gathers videos from popular funny subreddits.

## How does it work?

Using the Intersection Observer API, it checks whether the video element is visible on the screen, and plays or pauses depending if it *is* or *isn't* on the viewport. Allowing for autoplay. There's also a debounce  function making it so the application isn't requesting video data with every moment a new video is displayed in the viewport.
